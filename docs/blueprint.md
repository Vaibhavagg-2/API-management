# **App Name**: API Canopy

## Core Features:

- API Blueprint: API Design: Interactive interface for defining API endpoints, request/response schemas, and data models using OpenAPI or similar specifications.
- AI Policy Assistant: Policy Generator: Use AI as a tool to assist developers by recommending optimal API security and governance policies based on the API's functionality, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements. 
- Docs-as-code: API Documentation: Automatically generate interactive and up-to-date documentation from API definitions, enabling easy exploration and understanding for developers.
- RapidTest: API Testing: Facilitate testing by providing a simple UI to send test requests and validate responses against defined schemas, with support for automated test suites.
- Versioning: API Versioning: Enable developers to manage different versions of their APIs, allowing for seamless updates and backward compatibility.
- Browse APIs: API Discovery:  Implement a search interface to browse all available APIs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 214, 89%, 52% which is a vibrant azure blue (#0A84FF). It represents the reliable clarity of well-managed APIs. 
- Background color: HSL 214, 21%, 96% a light pale blue (#F0F8FF). 
- Accent color: HSL 184, 58%, 44% which is a slightly desaturated teal (#2DB6AC). 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use a set of consistent, outline-style icons that represent different API functions, policies, and actions. 
- Implement a card-based design for API listings and documentation, with clear sections for API details, endpoints, and code examples.
- Incorporate subtle transition effects (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) to provide visual feedback during user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
